# Phonebook-App

This PhoneBook Application is a program that I wrote to apply the knowledge I learned about object-oriented principles in a class.

You can run the program and input the data through command-line interface. 

This project is still currently under development 

My goal is to develop a GUI for this program using JavaFX
